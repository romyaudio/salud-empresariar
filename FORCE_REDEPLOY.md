This file is created to force a new deployment and apply environment variables.

Timestamp: 2025-10-09T19:45:00.000Z

## Issue
Environment variables are configured in Amplify Console but not being applied to the application.

## Solution
Force a new deployment to apply server-side environment variables:
- AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME
- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID  
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

## Expected Result
After deployment, `/api/s3/verify-config` should show `"serverComplete": true`
